# Pointers

## Types of Pointers:

### NULL Pointers: (pointing to no valid memory address)
### WILD Pointers: (pointing to random garbage address -->initial state)
### DANGLING Pointers: (At some point  (memory location is deallocated corr to the pointer) this is equivalent to WILD pointers)
### VOID Pointers: This is a special type of pointer available in C++ which represents the absence of type. Void pointers are pointers that point to a value that has no particular type. It also means that they can point to any data type.
